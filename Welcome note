I am an aspiring data analyst. I started my data journey around 2 years ago.
After graduating with a degree in Business Administration, I went to South Korea to teach English and travel.
I always knew that I wanted to work in corporate but didn't know which sector I wanted to be in until I heard about Data Analysts.
Coding has been a great curiosity for me and I felt that pursuing becoming a Data Analyst was a way to learn coding languages.
The projects that I'm uploading to this repository is to showcase my data analysis skills on platforms such as R, SQL, Power Bi amd Tableau.
