# Car Sales Data Analysis (Report and Dashboard created using Microsoft Power Bi

## Project Objective
I created a sales report for the years 2014 and 2015. I wanted to understand which brands of cars were sold the most between those 2 years in Northern America.

## Dataset Used
The dataset I used was sourced through a Google search. I do not recommend taking these insights as fact, as this dataset is not credible.

## Process
- Used Power Query to :
  * Verify data for missing values and anomalies.
  * Clean data in respect to data type, data format, column name and value errors.
  * Reduce model by removing unnecessary columns.
  * Create a Date Table.
- Used Power Bi to :
  * Create a relationship between the Date Table and Car Sales Table.
  * Mark the Date Table as a date table for hierarchy analysis.
  * Create measures for Total Sales and Sales YoY growth to include in KPI's.
  * Create report pages with visuals and slicers to drill-through to.
  * Create an interactive dashboard.

 ## Project Insights
  * Car sales in 2015 grew over 1000% in sales and number of cars sold.
  * In 2015, car sales were higher in the first 6 months of the year.
  * Domestic brands like Ford, Chevrolet and Dodge are in the top 10 sales by brand, with Ford being number 1.
  * Car sales of the top 10 brands contributed to over half of the total sales of $7.6bn.
  * The number of cars sold of the top 10 brands contributed to over half of the total number of cars sold which is 558,799 cars.
