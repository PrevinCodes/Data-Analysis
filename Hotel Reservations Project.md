# Hotel Reservations Data Analysis
I used MySQL and Power BI to complete this project.

## Project Objectives
- Use KPI's to answer the following questions:
  * What is the total income, total number of guests and total number of nights booked?
  * What is the retention rate, reservation success rate and reservation cancellation rate?
- Use Visuals to answer the following questions:
  * What is the highest market segment?
  * Which top 3 rooms are reserved the most?
  * What is the ratio of adults to children?
  * What is the ratio of new guests to old guests?
  * What is the ratio of successful reservations to cancellations?
  * What is the income by month?
  * What are the number of nights booked by month?

## Dataset Used
The dataset I used was sourced through a Google search. I do not recommend taking these insights as fact, as this dataset is not credible.

## Process
- Used MySQL to :
  * Verify data for missing and duplicate values.
  * Clean data.
  * Remove unnecessary columns.
  * Create a Date Table.
- Used Power Bi to :
  * Connect to my data in MySQL.
  * Create a Date Table.
  * Create a relationship between the Date Table and Hotel Reservations Table.
  * Mark the Date Table as a date table for hierarchy analysis.
  * Create measures to include in KPI's.
  * Create report pages with visuals and slicers.
  * Create interactive dashboards.

 ## Project Insights
  * The Reservation Cancellation rate is 32.76% while the Reservation Success Rate is 67.24%.
  * The Hotel lost $1.3M of potential income due to cancellations.
  * The Hotel's largest Market Segment is Online.
  * Room Type's 1, 4 and 6 are the Hotel's most booked rooms.
  * The Hotel's Retention rate is extremely low at 3.75% of 46k guests.
  * The Hotel sees a lot more of New Guests and Adult Guests when compared to Old Guests and Child Guests.
